    Terms A and E are due to the part of the first order spin orbitals which

    coefficients. We define :math:'^{w_p x}\Psi^{01}' and
    :math:'^{w x_p}\Psi^{01}'determinants where the the pth column
    of the zeroth order MO coefficient matrix has been replaced with the pth
    column of the first order MO coefficient matrix then Lowdin pair.

    Terms B and D are due to the part of the first order spin orbitals which
    are first order AO basis functions expanded using zeroth order MO
    coefficients. This is achieved by defining modified atomic orbital overlap
    matrices in which the pth row or column has been replaced by the
    corresponding overlap where either the bra or ket AO function has been
    differentiated, and using these overlap matrices in Lowdin pairing with
    the zeroth order MO coefficient matrices.

    Term C does not contribute to the overlap.
